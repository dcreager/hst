Release 1.0-α3:

  • CSPM compiler

      Many language features are implemented.  The following aren't:
        • sequence comprehensions
        • set comprehensions
        • dotted channels
        • special definitions
        • comments
        • type definitions
        • include files

      Also, many process operators are not yet supported, since the
      underlying CSP₀ library also doesn't support them.
