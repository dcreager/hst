The tests in this directory are broken down into the following basic
categories.  If you are writing a new test case, and it fits into one
of these categories, please name the test accordingly.  If your test
defines a new category, make sure you describe it here, and make sure
you add enough test cases to this new category to provide full
coverage (of all of the CSP operators, for instance).

00-*
    Test the basic operational semantics of each CSP operator.

02-mem-*
    Test the memoization routines in the prescence of expanded
    operators.  For instance, defining an extchoice requires drilling
    down through the LTS of each operand.  If a later process is then
    defined to be one of the sub-extchoices, we should reuse that
    existing result.

05-rec-*
    Test recursive processes, ensuring that they don't (for instance)
    cause an infinite loop when the process is well-defined.

10-*
    Test combinations of operators.

80-*
    Tests more sophisticated, real process definitions.  These will
    often come from a textbook or paper, in which case, the test name
    should somehow include the author or title of the work it comes
    from.
