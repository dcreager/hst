HST
===

HST is a library and set of command-line programs for processing CSP
scripts.  The goal for the 1.0 release is to support refinement
checking in the traces (T), stable failures (F), and
failures-divergences (N) semantic models, all of which are described
in [1].

For installation instructions, please see the INSTALL file.  There is
currently a single command-line program, called “csp0”, which allows
you to perform refinement checks on scripts written in the CSP₀
language.  The program is self-documented; run “csp0 help” for usage
details.  The CSP₀ language is described in the csp0.html file, which
should be installed as part of the standard installation process.
