I'll write more later.  For now, to compile this package, you need:

 * cmake
 * libjudy

It's highly recommended that you perform an out-of-source build.
Create a directory to hold the build results:

  mkdir ${BUILD_DIR}
  cd ${BUILD_DIR}
  cmake ${PATH_TO_LIBHST_SOURCE}
  make
  make test
  make install
