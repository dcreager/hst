I'll write more detailed notes later.  For now, to compile this
package, you need:

 * cmake
 * bison
 * asciidoc
 * xmlto
 * libjudy

The first four are only needed at build-time.  The last is required at
runtime as well.

It's highly recommended that you perform an out-of-source build.
Decide on values for the following:

  SRC_DIR:   the top-level “hst” source directory.

  BUILD_DIR: the directory where you will perform the build.  (It's
             fine if this is a subdirectory of ${SRC_DIR}).

  PREFIX:    the filesystem directory that you want to install into.
             This will usually be /usr, /usr/local, ${HOME}, or
             something similar.

Then execute the following:

  mkdir ${BUILD_DIR}
  cd ${BUILD_DIR}
  cmake \
    -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:string=RELEASE \
    -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:string=${PREFIX} \
    ${SRC_DIR}
  make
  make test
  sudo make install

(You'll obviously only need the “sudo” if you're installing into a
system-wide directory.)
